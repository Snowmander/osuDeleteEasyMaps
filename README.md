# osuDeleteEasyMaps
Deletes osu maps without harder difficulties.

Retrieves StarDifficulty from osu!API and deletes beatmapsets that don't contain a difficulty greater than specified difficulty.
You need to build osu.db after running the script. (F5 ingame)

Work in progress. I don't guarantee that your entire beatmap library doesn't get deleted.
